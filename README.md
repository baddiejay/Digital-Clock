# Digital-Clock
Project that I realized with one of my classmates in the laboratory of the digital electronics course that I attended during my Erasmus period at Rovira i Virgili university.

The goal of the lab was to implement a digital clock in VHDL on a Digilent Basys 2 FPGA.

The clock shows the time in the format HH:MM starting from 00:00 and can be configured with appropriate selection buttons. It's possible to set an alarm that is displayed as a led that can be turned off with a switch. With an appropriate switch it is also possible to switch to chronometer mode where seconds and milliseconds are displayed. The chronometer can be paused and resetted.
